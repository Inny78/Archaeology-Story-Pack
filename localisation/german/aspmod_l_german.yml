 ### Archaeology: A Bedroom Planet
 site_ASP_a_bedroom_planet: "Bedroom Planet"
 site_ASP_a_bedroom_planet_intro: "A large number of abandoned structures have been found on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. These buildings are highly sophisticated and designed to efficiently meet the survival needs of their inhabitants. Unexpectedly, they also happen to be filled with the corpses of those inhabitants.\n\nFrom what we've been able to piece together, this species relied entirely upon these vast automation systems for their survival. Their subsequent deaths, coincidentally, appear to have been caused by the widespread failure of those systems. In fact, most of these buildings are dwellings devoid of other apparent functions. It's like a massive assisted living complex.\n\nWe've discovered a few industrial and military installations among the vast array of automated buildings, but the ratio of dwellings to infrastructure suggests this group relied near-exclusively on external support for survival.\n\nWe'll keep digging and see what else we can come up with."
 ASPmod.10.name: "Ground Survey"
 ASPmod.10.desc: "In addition to minimal infrastructure, the inhabitants of this planet had little-to-no signs of economic activity either. Wreckage from orbital elevators and space station debris found across the planet's surface supports our theories that the inhabitants relied heavily, if not entirely, upon imports of food and other consumer goods. The only real activity they seem to have been involved in was lichen cultivation. Facilities were also uncovered in the central areas of their residences; perhaps these lichens were part of their diet or entertainment?\n\n Regardless, the characteristics of this cultivation are inconsistent with the planetary ecosystem, suggesting it is not native. Even more confusingly, these systems are completely isolated from the outside environment to a degree of fanatic paranoia. These spaces have been exceptionally well secured, yet, unlike the residences, there are no traces of the actual lichens that were being cultivated.\n\n Further investigation will be required."
 ASPmod.11.name: "The Ranches"
 ASPmod.11.desc: "We've pieced together a more complete picture of the fate of the inhabitants of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. The residential facilities only provide for survival because that is all they were designed to do. This planet was dedicated to the industry of ranching cattle, and the species we found was presumably being raised as that food source. We suspect the odd lichen facilities were the residences and control centers of their owners, and that we incorrectly assumed the role of rancher and livestock. However, we do know that the livestock species died out because these automated systems were purposefully turned off.\n\n It is a bit horrifying, a species closely resembling our own serving as a §Ydelicious delicacy§! for some unknown alien. Thankfully there is nothing in our records about a lichen-like civilization that eats people. Nonetheless, based on the size of the ranch, we can safely posit there was a massive demand for §Ylivestock§! raised in this facility: their empire would have been quite large.\n\nIt's uncomfortable, but, given the similarities between our species, these spaces could be refurbished to make comfortable residences for our own people."
 ASPmod.11.option: "As long as we aren't eating them."
 d_ASP_a_bedroom_planet_blocker: "Abandoned Ranch Facilities"

 ### Archaeology: Dawn Star is Coming
 site_ASP_dawn_star_is_coming: "Dawn Star is Coming"
 site_ASP_dawn_star_is_coming_intro: "§Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!'s surface has a crater so large that it can be seen from space. But the artificial forms of debris on the surface indicate that there was once a time of civilization on this desolate planet. A surface scan has shown that this debris appears to be the topmost part of a building. Most of the traces of civilization seem to be hidden in the sandstorms of the planet.\n\nFurther investigation is required."
 ASPmod.30.name: "The Dawn Star"
 ASPmod.30.desc: "Our archaeological team has sent in their report from §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. According to the findings, all the civilizations that once flourished on this planet seem to have collapsed in just one night. A giant meteorite hit the planet, turning it into a hellscape in just a few hours. The discovery of a huge city buried beneath the crater suggests that the civilization that once lived here was very materialistic and possessed intelligence. Furthermore, based on primitive forms of satellites in low orbit around the planet, it is believed that they reached the early space age.\n\nAt the same time, we found records of a song that was often sung. Although we initially didn't know what it meant, our researchers were able to translate one of the most repetitive words in the song.\n\nThe word is "§HDawn Star§!.""
 ASPmod.31.name: "First Phrase"
 ASPmod.31.desc: "There was a variety of opinions among archaeologists at the site about the song, "§HDawn Star§!," which was discovered on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. It's a bit of a mystery that people with extremely rational and advanced civilizations repeatedly sang a single piece of music that was not just a local fad, but was identified across the entire planet, regardless of gender, age and strata.\n\nArchaeologists suggest this song as religious chant or shamanistic spells, but none of them gave a clear answer. But there was some success in translating this song."
 ASPmod.32.name: "Second Phrase"
 ASPmod.32.desc: "Archaeologists report that they have found decisive clues in the archaeological investigation of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!. It appears that they made a desperate effort to avoid the extinction of their civilization before the meteorite fell. Since they observed the meteorite, a huge amount of records have been found, all saying that they tried to stop it.\n\nBut all the efforts to destroy the meteorite with weapons, including nuclear missiles, or even change the trajectory of the meteorite, went unsuccessful. They were unable to prevent their destruction with their own strength, and realized that a bright star in the night sky was a disaster that would lead them to an end.\n\nThey eventually started building huge escape ships to keep only a small number of people alive. Huge spaceships have been found all over the planet to carry as many people as possible, and most of them seem to have come to an end without even launching. Realizing that only a limited number of people could survive, people flocked to the ship, and force was used to control them.\n\nBut those who wanted to survive the end of their world were equally desperate to seize the spacecrafts using force. A relatively undamaged device, which was found deep in the excavation site, contained a voice record that gave us a little §Ymore insight§! into the song of the new star, which was being sung by the men who were confronting the spacecraft at that time."
 ASPmod.33.name: "Final Phrase"
 ASPmod.33.desc: "The excavation of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is complete. Our archaeologists couldn't find any new scientific discoveries or anything surprising at the excavation site. In fact, their remains were not special. But it's clear that their end will make a deep impression on our archaeologists. The residents seemed to have not given up hope of escape until the effect of the meteorite prevented the spacecrafts from launching. Their obsession with survival was more tenacious and desperate than any other species in the galaxy, but only a small number of escape ships were able to make it. \n\nOther escape ships that didn't leave the planet were attacked and destroyed in an attempt to get their supplies, while other spacecrafts exploded in accidents, drifted endlessly in space due to poor planning, or were completely forgotten. And when the last hope was lost, the citizens were left with despair and helplessness.\n\nFrom that point on, their communication records were completely cut off, and each region was completely isolated. There may have been communication failures due to the effect of the meteorite, but they didn't communicate with anyone, even if it was possible. They died slowly, but surely, listening to the occasional song of the dawn stars. Our archaeologists were able to restore a family's voice records, which appeared to have been recorded when the §Ymeteorite§! nearly reached the planet."

 ### Archaeology: The Ship of Theseus
 site_ASP_the_ship_of_theseus: "Ship of Theseus"
 site_ASP_the_ship_of_theseus_intro: " According to the report of our archaeological team, the city on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is very similar to that of ours. Carbon dating process tells us that the city is at least 6000 years old.\n\nIt is hard to answer the reason why our architectural style can be found on the surface of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!, which is located a million miles away from our homeland. Weathering over several millennia has buried the city under sand and dust. More excavation will be needed for further investigation."
 ASPmod.40.name: "The Residential Area"
 ASPmod.40.desc: " Under the mountain of sand, we finally excavated a residential area of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§!'s civilization. Its resemblance to ours is more than an appearance; the structure of a house of §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is made of ferrocement, the same as our houses in the last century. The appliances found inside the house are also of similar use to ours.\n\nIt is controversial whether this similarity is from coincidence or from architectural convergent evolution. The only consensus among the team is that further digging is needed for the answer."
 ASPmod.41.name: "Native's Fossil"
 ASPmod.41.desc: "A fossil of a native species has been found under ruins of a park. The reconstruction of the native's skeletal structure shows a lot of things; the native species are sentient arthropods with two jaws and twelve legs. A biologist on our science team also reported that the species has an organ that exhales acidic breath. The overall appearance of the species is disgusting and looks likes it has just jumped out from the §Y[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!'s nightmares.\n\nMeanwhile, our team has discovered that the institution we found seems to be a research foundation."
 ASPmod.41.option: "What a disgusting alien."
 ASPmod.42.name: "Biotechnology"
 ASPmod.42.desc: "According to our team's report, it seems the native species were very skillful at biotechnology. The overall technological level of the civilization is approximately equivalent compared to ours, except for their biotechnology. The research lab of the natives was full of cloning vats; we assume that their population growth depends on technology. Most of the vats are filled with §Y"horrible"§! dead bodies of the native species.\n\nThe team found that the dead bodies in the vats have a trivial difference in appearance with the restored fossil. Its appearance is still §Y"horrible"§!, but the number of legs is decreased to 10. Some of the team members were opposed to continued investigation, due to its appearance."
 ASPmod.42.option.a: "After investigate the damn aliens, incinerate it."
 ASPmod.42.option.b: "It is racist to describe §Y"different"§! appearance as §Y"horrible"§!. Reeducate the members."
 ASPmod.42.option.c: "When I say jump, you just jump."
 ASPmod.42.option.d: "It's for science."
 ASPmod.43.name: "Genetic Change"
 ASPmod.43.desc: "Detailed investigation has told us that genes of the dead bodies among the vats has changed as little as its appearance. Assuming a single vat is a single generation, the DNA difference between each generation does not differ much from the natural mutation.\n\nIt gets progressively more different, however, as the generations passed. What seems to be an endlessly continued array of vats is cut off at the front of gigantic blast door with a security device next to it on the wall. A dead body in the last vat has only four legs, less than previously, and its jaws are now just a single jaw. Our team has reported that if they could hack into the security device then they could get into the room behind the blast door."
 ASPmod.43.option: "What are you waiting for? Go on."
 ASPmod.44.name: "The Truth"
 ASPmod.44.desc: "The result was shocking.\n\nOur species are not evolved from §Y[Root.Owner.GetHomeWorldName]§!. §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was where we were born and... were made. After hacking the terminal, the team has found a gigantic computer and as well as a lot of vats filling the room.\n\nA dead body in one of the vats, with an appearance of a four-legged arthropod, was changed into §Y[Root.GetSpeciesName]§!. Inside the last vat made before the collapsing of the civilization is a dead floating body genetically identical with our species.\n\nIt seems that they genetically engineered their species into our species. Most of the records in the computer pointed out how the appearance of the species they made are horrible and intolerable.\n\nAccording to the document in the computer, this make-horrible-procedure was a punishment for a traitor or a brutal criminal. The criminals that were changed into this horrible form were generally executed after the change, while a greater punishment was to banish prisoners to an alien planet. As we expected, one of the planet they banished the prisoners to is our homeland."

 ### ASP_kessler_syndrome
 ASP_site_kessler_syndrome: "Kessler Syndrome"
 ASP_site_kessler_syndrome_desc: "The atmosphere of [From.Planet.GetName] is filled with countless metal fragments, evidently of artificial structures. Is it a sign of a civilization that failed to enter space age due to space debris? We need to send an expedition to the planet to find out what happened here."
 asp.7.name: "Metallic Desert"
 asp.7.desc: "The surface of [From.Planet.GetName] has been repeatedly covered with sand of finely ground metals over a long period of time. This huge amount of metal could not have come from a single planet. The source of these metals is obvious; even now space junk is burning and falling in the sky. To investigate what is under this vast metal desert, the expedition team has asked for additional equipment to investigate the stratum under the sand."
 asp.8.name: "Remnants of the Great War"
 asp.8.desc: "We've figured out what is underneath the metallic sand. Amazingly, the whole stratum was made up of battleship debris. During the Great Space War that broke out at a certain point in the past, the destroyed ships crashed into the ground, and the debris in the atmosphere was weathering and covering it.\n\nNow, only the remains are left, but the markings alone show that the civilization that created the battleship has developed technology beyond the comprehension of [Root.Owner.GetName]. The question is, the debris appears to belong to the same empire. What did this huge, powerful fleet fight against? Further investigation of the wreckage is needed."
 asp.9.name: "Huge Ship with Unknown Purpose"
 asp.9.desc: "Our team found something amazing. A massive ship rose up through the metallic sand, big enough to make even titans of the fallen empires look like a corvette. The ship was lucky enough to have been unusually well-preserved compared to many other ships which had shattered.\n\nWe have scanned the entire structure and found that the ship looks like a giant cannon. The ship's giant hull appears to be designed only for supplying energy to its main battery. But this ship is not for combat purposes. It takes months to charge energy, and there's no other armament. We need to access the ship's central system to know what happened to this planet and this ship."
 asp.10.name: "Mysterious Data Storage"
 asp.10.desc: "Almost every system of the ship has been damaged over time. However, a data storage found in the protected cabin in the core can be restored. For further investigation, the storage was sent to home world. Some scientists remained on the planet to study the ships and planets more."
 asp.11.name: "Impenetrable Wall"
 asp.11.desc: "After a long study, the scientists finally solved it. The giant ship is a device that uses energy to create, as the senior scientist says, "an impenetrable wall." This ship was completely isolating the planet from space, and the fleet was there to protect it. While the planet was cut off from its surroundings, the ship and the fleet crashed into the wall and were destroyed.\n\nUnderneath the debris, there is the dimensional wall which separate the planet from the entire universe. When this wall was first installed, it was surely "impenetrable", but it seems quite unstable now. If we figure out the solution, we can "penetrate" this wall and explore what lies beneath."
 asp.11.a: "What is it down there?"
 asp.12.name: "Restore Complete"
 asp.12.desc: "The data storage we found has been restored. Inside, a document was found written with alien characters. In our interpretation of the document, the words "Motherland" and "home" have been repeatedly used, and appear to be a memoir. The author is the head of state of the Empire when it is about to collapse and is in charge of recording the history of his empire. The document also contains information about the giant ship."

If this continues, the walls will soon disappear.\n\nThe document has finally been fully decrypted. The Commonwealth of Humanity, the owner of the ship, was once a powerful empire that conquered one-third of the galaxy. They massacred or enslaved aliens and suppressed the rights of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhen they finally met a powerful enemy, alien slaves and artificial intelligence inside revolted, and the empire quickly collapsed from the strain of being attacked from both within and on their borders. They were left with only their home planet. They sealed themselves inside in order to protect their motherland, their home, and the future of humanity, waiting for the day that they would breach the wall and conquer the galaxy again..."

This one was such a case.\n\nIf the test run of the new exploration probe had been performed elsewhere, if it wasn't faulty and thus did not crash, if one of our explorers didn't slip over 'the cylinder', and if the rotation axis of the planet hadn't inclined by 8 degrees as he fell, this common barren-type planet would have gotten no recognition from anybody.\n\nOur science vessel that was monitoring the situation sent a transmission to the explorer asking what had happened, which sounded more like a scream. The explorer reported that most of 'the cylinder' is buried deep into the ground and is longer than what could be scanned.\n\nWell, first of all, health check on the explorer should be performed, it's wonder they seem okay after being on the ground that moved at the speed of several hundred kilo meters per second."
 asp.36.name: "Chapter I"
 asp.36.desc: "Even our best scanners could not scan the whole of 'the cylinder', which is abnormally thin for being so long. However, it is certain that 'the cylinder' has penetrated the crust.\n\nCloset-wide smooth white cylinder, 'the needle' as our explorers call it, denies all attempts to scan the insides, and even though it is so incredibly long, it is embedded in the ground in the exact direction of the center of the planet without errors. Our explorers are more curious about the fact that nothing is around where the needle is, even more so than that its sheer length and the material it is made of. They have scanned the planet to be sure, but no signs of artificial activities whatsoever has been found, let alone ruins of a civilization with the technology level advanced enough to craft such a needle. It is stuck in the ground all alone, like a needle stuck in a ball of string.\n\nBut the most strange thing is that pushing the needle makes the planet spin. Although our exploration team is so terrified that they refused to push the needle anymore, the rotation axis of the planet has already been slanted more than 60 degrees compared to the initial axis.\n\nOur explorers on the surface report that they have not felt the spinning of the planet, even though they have seen the sky spin and heard the safety alarm went off like crazy."

Our scientists are arguing that the whole planet is in another dimension.\n\nWith renewed motivation, our explorers began analyzing the needle. The planet spun 257 turns during the collection of material sample of the needle, but our explorers already got used to it."

As far as we know, these kind of materials are quite astonishing, but of no use even if one had succeeded in making them.\n\nAfter ripping of the exterior parts of the needle, our team found nothing on the interior. No machinery, no sensors, but just a hole of unthinkable depth. They set up a drone transmission relay base, and sent a explorer drone down below. It wasn't completely empty. As it went deeper, it had to face stronger gravity currents, which eventually blew it up.\n\nOur second exploration team tasked with the boring task of searching the entire planet microscopically had unearthed another needle, on the opposite side of the planet. In fact, it is the same needle. As our team shoot a laser beam down the first needle, it came out the second one. The needle completely penetrated the planet.\n\nScientist assume that the needle is serving a role as some sort of signal amplifier to rotate space, but are unable to come up with any explanations about how or why the needle came to be."

More changes have been observed in various areas, and the extent of the changes changed according to the distance with the needle.\n\nIt's quite nice to find out something at least, but our scientist are having trouble getting a consensus on the reason of those changes. Conducting more experiments is needed."
 asp.40.desc.1: "After countless weirdly-improvised experiments followed by tedious manual checks, our team has discovered that the device is a sort of a wedge, forcefully binding the multiverse. The spherical space surrounding the planet is actually the intersecting space of 88 multiverses. The planet exists in 88 multiverses at the same time. It is using the comparatively forgiving laws of physics of the 15th universe to spin space.\n\nThe most reasonable assumption would be that the needle had been made to cross over to the other universe. Perhaps changing the direction of the needle changes the destination. Still, we have no idea how to use it, or who tried to use it or why did they tried. The only beings with the knowledge of using the device might have already gone over to other universes.\n\nIt's unlikely that we will be using the needle as initially intended, but by powering up the needle we can reproduce the laws of physics of other universes albeit in small scale.

Sounds of burning flesh, cracking bones, and the screams of mercy come out. Our team on the surface tries to contact him, but to no avail. The scientist is trying to let the team know what's happening down there. It seems even when in pain, he is determined to give us the knowledge. He repeats the same thing again and again in a barley comprehensible, groaning voice.\n\nThat it is hell down there. Demons and monsters, every conceivable evil are there.\n\nSoon the voice falters, and half of our explorers, even as shivering with extreme anxiety, showed obsessive curiosity towards the insides of the needle. They shove off their colleagues that were trying to stop them, and jumped down into the needle. The rest of the team retreated back to the science vessel in panic, as thick purple smoke began to spread over the surface.\n\nIt seems like the planet has turned into a veiled planet. A report just came through informing that an unidentified purple ship has appeared out of thin air. The ship is armed with a single bizarre-looking cannon. It is just staying on orbit, not moving at all, which leads us to believe that it's not staffed. It might hold the answers we seek."
 asp.40.desc.2: "After decrypting the records found inside the ominous purple ship, our team was able to tell what the planet and the needle were.\n\nThe cylinder we referred to as the needle was in fact 'The Roundworm of the Veil' - a psionic monster which had being traveling across galaxies and devouring the spirits and bodies of sentient beings. Even after destroying tens of thousand of civilization, the worm never felt full. The Vermifugum, a civilization that came under attack by the worm 790 million years ago, succeeded in neutralizing the worm, and created a prison between the veil dimension and the real universe, penetrated the worm with the bar of the veil dimension, contained it inside a rocky planet in the real universe. The planet was disguised as a common barren-type planet to prevent a younger species from breaking the seal by accident.\n\nThe records also advised us at the end to use the 'flint' loaded on the purple ship to burn down the worm along with the veil, in case the seal is broken and the planet fell into the veil.\n\nAs our scientists read the last part, they witness the worm escape from the planet and float away. They panicked as they realized that they have lost the last chance to destroy the worm, but fortunately for us the worm left for another galaxy.\n\nOnly the surviving explorers know what we have done.

At first the others though he was just kidding, but as time went by, more and more people were having similar experiences.\n\nIt soon became mandatory to write down the direction the needle was pointing to, at which angle the observer was holding the needle at the time of such occurrences. As the records piled up, it became clear that the needle showed specific planets according to the direction of the needle, the angle at which the needle was held, and what the explorer was saying at the time.\n\nThe existence of the celestial bodies seen through the needles must be verified."
 asp.40.desc.3: "As the team fiddle with the needle according to what the scientists have discovered, the gravity current inside the needle stabilizes in lens-like form, and the view of the other side gets magnified. The celestial bodies the team had seen were indeed real, and the scientists could discover new planets as well.\n\nThe needle is a gigantic deep space telescope. Whoever built this ridiculous telescope, or whatever technologies had been used to build it, we still do not know, but we do know how to use it.\n\nResearch on areas that are not easily accessible by hyperspace travel was very difficult even to this day where we can see planets far across with ones own eyes and travel faster than light. However, this telescope will break open new possibilities for astronomy. Now observers can see the stars far across the galaxy as if they were right in front of their eyes, and they also can film and analyze external galaxies more vividly. Our military leaders wanted to use the telescope in the field of espionage, but as it is impossible to zoom in once the planet is magnified to a certain degree, it's not likely that they can get useful information on the surface as they would have wanted.\n\nThe telescope has also become quite famous for tourists. The now super popular needle is now called the 'Limitless Observatory', a perfect planetarium where tourists can see every single stars and planets in the galaxy."

 asp.40.desc.5: " Most of the probes that attempted FTL travel in the neighboring system traveled normally, but the ones that were on the direction at which the needle pointed had unusual occurrences. The probes that entered hyperspace lanes toward the system where the needle is at traveled at faster speed than normal, and the ones that entered hyperspace lanes toward other systems have been somehow teleported to the low orbit of the planet and crashed into the ground.\n\nHowever, only small ships like civilian spacecrafts and probes were affected. Anything with more mass than a patrol ship worked mostly fine. Also, it has been theoretically proven that by powering up the needle, we can cut pseudo-lightspeed by half according to the amount and polarization of the power supplied, and also suppress the overheating of engines when making a 'jump' onto the phase above ordinary universe.\n\nOur scientist have concluded for now that the needle had been constructed to create an 'FTL highway', and the rotating functionality of the planet was intended to serve as a switch point.\n\nHowever, no one knows how this thing works, or why should the needle be planted into the planet, or what kind of civilization had built it. No more leads exists.\n\nBut our civilization has undeniably gained a lot from this incident.

 ASP_site_strangely_fertile_world_desc: " This planet seemingly looks nothing special. However initial survey suggests its extraordinary ecosystems, enough to draw attention of our scientists."
 asp.58.name: "Fertile Ruins"
 asp.58.desc: " At first glance, this seems to be a regular inhabitable planet. However, our initial research has revealed that the planet is strangely fertile. The planet's soil contains very large amount of organic matter even when compared to galactic standards. No animals have been found on the ground nor in the water. Although it seems to be inhabited solely by plant life, yet ruins possibly of once advanced civilization exist.\n\nOur explorers arrived at the great city ruins, which we presume to be the once-prospered capital of the planet. Most of the city is buried underground, the rest covered with plants. More research is needed to identify the reasons behind the civilization's downfall."
 asp.59.name: "Temple"
 asp.59.desc: " Our scientists theorized that an out-of-control experiment caused the extinction, until our radiocarbon dating techniques have verified the that plants have grown rapidly taking advantage of plentiful nutrients after the inhabitants were gone. The planet's technology level before extinction was just beyond FTL travel, and the inhabitants are believed to have been bringing back resources from outer space to their home using this technology.\n\nLike most other civilizations of similar technological advancement, they have filled the upper echelon of the city with many symbolic structures and sculptures, which include multiple instances of symbols resembling DNA double helix. Most of those symbols are adorned with jewelry, which led our researchers to believe that the symbols are somehow related to the dominant religion or ideology.\n\n Many messages have been found inside those 'temples' as our team calls them, but most of them do not seem to be more than mere symbols. To acquire more information, underground excavation is required."
 asp.60.name: "Skeletons"
 asp.60.desc: " An enormous amount of fossilized bones have been unearthed from the stratum, where our scientists assume to have been the street level when the inhabitants were around. Fossilized bones from various species at the same stratum hints a massive extinction happened at that time. Since no evidence suggest the inclusion of plant life in the extinction, our team is led to believe that the world-wide extinction was strictly limited to animal life. The plants could draw nutrients from the organic matter that the animals have left behind and grew rapidly, our scientists concluded.\n\nAmong the said bones, some were distorted to badly to the point where their origins could not be traced. Further analysis of the bones revealed that they underwent severe transformation due to unknown reasons, while being genetically similar to other animals. Our scientists argue that some kind of mutant epidemic might have caused the extinction. Protective gears might be needed in order to commence deeper excavation."
 asp.61.name: "Conversions"
 asp.61.desc: "As our excavation team dug into the deeper areas under the city, they found a gigantic hidden complex in which temples, laboratories, and government buildings were incorporated. The complex is thought to be the most important facility and religious center of the city, as can be hinted from the level of security and its size. In the complex were an abundance of recordings which showed the last days of the civilization.\n\nThe inhabitants believed that death is not the end, and all conflicts will end by being spiritually united with the resurrected, which led them to refrigerate dead bodies in the temples, and try to research resurrection technology. But their research did not result in not resurrections, but biological abominations. Those abominations slaughtered and infected the entire planet's population, and their tradition of preserving the dead bodies at the very center of their society only accelerated the process. The whole civilization fell without much of a resistance soon after it's central religious government was destroyed."

The structure turned out to be a beacon of some sort, and the waves were no simple natural radiation, but messages directly invasive to intellectual beings' brains, influencing them negatively as a result.\n\nAfter some careful investigation, our researchers were able to come up with an analysis of the waves. The structure infuses nearby life forms with the images of death, resurrection, and union in addition to injecting technological knowledge about creating biological abominations out of dead bodies, and also urges them into building multiple structures identical to it. It was not at all natural that the civilization came to worship the structure. Our researchers expect to find more of those structures if they dug deeper."

Since no artificial structures had been found on the satellite during the initial investigation, our team expects to find more information from the spaceship."
 asp.64.name: "Truth"
 asp.64.desc: " A terrifying truth has been uncovered by the recordings and various data on the ship. The red structure found under the city was but one of many mass products, all of which can be traced back to the dark structure in the center of the satellite.\n\nThe dark structure is in fact a planet-sized parasite's core, which repeated the horrid process of mind controlling entire population of planets and slaughtering them, in order to crumple the resulted organic matter into more of itself. This is the meaning of the core belief of the planet's religion- death, resurrection and union.\n\nBut it seems a certain heroic group of engineers defeated this abomination using an early model excavation ship. They were able to slip into the orbit of the satellite, avoiding its attacks, and then used the gigantic excavator to practically rip off the core of the satellite, and the dark structure along with it. The corpse-satellite met its doom, and the galaxy became a bit safer thanks to this heroic feat.\n\nThe heroes seem to have been able to evacuate to the surrounding area of their homeworld. They built a little colony and established a force field to protect themselves from the waves emitted from the dark structure, and spent their last years there.\n\nWhat a truly heroic ending to the story."

Scientists are showing much interest in the quite unique ecosystem of this planet, in which many creatures with not-so-beneficial, strange genetic features have been found. We have also found ruins that look like remnants of a once advanced civilization.\n\nSporadic anti-scanning waves are detected on the planet and under the sea. However, our researchers could land and gather information on the surface of the planet.\n\nThe scan-interfering waves are completely blocking any advanced AI from approaching the planet by unidentifiable means. Any AI that reaches low orbit shuts down in a fit of errors. Thus, synth scientists and AI-assisted scientists are unable to explore the planet."
 asp.65.name: "Bacteria?"
 asp.65.desc: "The first thing that baffled our explorers when they searched the planet was the corpse of the natives, mummified by the micro organisms, floating around on the sea surface. Apparently, blood was what reddened the ocean.\n\nHowever, it seems highly unlikely mummies bled enough to make the whole ocean red. Our scientists could not find the reason behind the unnatural amount of blood cells in the water. Yet, they have a theory that some sort of organism have caused this. Although oxygen is poisonous for most primitive organisms, it is a pretty common process that the oxygen-emitting bacteria change the composition of atmosphere completely. There might exist organisms that multiplies blood cells, though our scientist are unsure how it might benefit such organisms.\n\nThe dark cloud was made up of aerosol and toxic gas, and the destruction of the planet had a similar pattern to that of a dead planet, with no signs of an attack from outside. It is just as our scientists initially assumed. The planet, just like all great civilizations do, met its doom in the form of a civil war."

Upon further investigations, they have discovered that the planet was originally arctic, and the vast ocean taking up the majority of the planet seems to have been formed within just a few decades!\n\nBut as the civilization appears to have adapted to the environmental changes without too many problems, it is highly unlikely that it caused the downfall of the civilization.\n\nOur scientists are very excited as they discover new species after another while dissecting corpse which were floating on the sea. It is safe to say that nearly all the then-existed-species from around the galaxies have gathered here on this planet.\n\nHowever, the buildings seem to have been designed just for one specific mechanical species. One of the scientists argue that the planet was actually a capital of an ancient galactic federation, only to face serious problems during the inhabitants' synthetic ascension process, which led to their demise. Other scientists are dismissing the theory."

However, our scientists who are dealing with these waves head on have not reported feeling any negative influence at all. The waves have a very unfamiliar form and only destroys advanced forms of artificial intelligence.\n\nWe must wait for the explorers who have dived into the sea with only primitive equipments in order to avoid being influenced by the machine-destroying waves, to come up with meaningful results."

In fact, the vast ocean itself IS blood. Various micro organisms have turned its chemical composition to some extent, but it is entirely made of blood.\n\n Our people have found approximately 10 billion corpse and even corpse of species from other galaxies.\n\n Recordings investigation team also reported their findings. The planet belonged to a synthetic civilization, which gathered organics from around all the galaxies to this planet and slaughtered them. Even after the corpse covered the entire planet, they continue on their insane and inefficient endeavor."

Only focused with their god's murderer being an organic, they disregarded every other detail.\n\nThe planet became flooded with psionic waves as the blood ocean formed after all the intelligent and semi intelligence species, including the invaders have been massacred. The phenomenon is unheard of until now because no one had ever thought of, let alone tried to slaughter so many lives. With tens of billions of corpses buried in it, the planet began to emit psionic waves coming out from the shrouded dimension.\n\n The waves are harmless to organics, but fatal to synthetics. The synths were able to exterminate all the organic life forms in the galaxy, but began destroying each other being affected by the psionic waves. The entire civilization were eventually affected by the waves and it met its demise along with all the organics they have murdered.\n\n Our explorers have unearthed the so-called 'God' of the synths from the majestic tomb in the deepest part of the ruins.\n\nIt was but an organic.

 ASP_site_parasite_machine_desc: " Indication of advanced civilization remains on this planet. Problem is, there are no intelligent life forms detected in the planet."
 asp.89.name: "A World that killed itself"
 asp.89.desc: " We found traces of civilization on the continental planet in the system. Cities, industrial complex, plantations which only advanced civilizations could have built have been found albeit in ruins and several life forms have also been detected.\n\nHowever, there were no signs of intelligent life forms. What happened to the inhabitants of this planet? We can't say for sure yet. Further investigation is strongly suggested."
 asp.89.a: "Investigate further."
 asp.90.name: "Union of World Socialist Republics"
 asp.90.desc: " Our researchers have found that the destroyed civilization had a unified planetary government, even though it didn't have enough scientific knowledge to have discovered FTL space travel. The now disappeared inhabitants of this planet seem to have been able to unify the world after some sort of successful extremist revolution. We have also detected a large amount of radioactive matter, which implies a nuclear war.\n\nNow that time has passed, radioactivity levels have been greatly reduced. The majority of information we have gathered on this planet have been stored as digital data on the gigantic computer network built by the bygone civilization, although we also found significant amount of data written on paper."
 asp.90.a: "Commies kill themselves most, in history."
 asp.90.b: "Computer network, surely a sea of information."
 asp.90.c: "We must find what's behind this tragedy."

 asp.91.name: "Record of Self Destroyed World"
 asp.91.desc: "We were able to acquire a record of the daily lives on this planet. Our researchers have reported to have felt strange feeling of fear after seeing the footage, which contained the panic-stricken breakdown of peaceful lives. The recording ended abruptly after showing screen distortions."
 asp.91.a: "Odd."
 asp.92.name: "ASGU"
 asp.92.desc: "The investigation on the computer network never rested even while we decrypted their language. An investigation team have come up with a astounding news that they have located some sort of physical database of the network in the remains of a city. It looks like a well defended building, although currently not operated as of now.\n\n We have not finished gathering information, but already found a significant amount of repetition of the word 'Cybersin' in multiple documents. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the word refers to cyber communism. Although we still have a long way to go in identifying the whole network system, the name of the network is believed to be ASGU."
 asp.92.a: "It's obvious why they collapsed. Disassemble it."
 asp.92.b: "Is this the road we didn't taken?"

 asp.93.name: "Creepy AI"
 asp.93.desc: " We were able to fix and reoperate ASGU. It was no simple automated economic system. It actually reigned as the sole ruler of the planet according to its records. ASGU was armed with secret agencies and automated military forces. It rigged the elections so flawlessly that the natives did not realize what had been going on until the very end. It was only 34 minutes before the destruction of their entire civilization that they finally realized ASGU's intentions."
 asp.93.a: "It's creepy. Disassemble and analyze it."
 asp.93.b: "We have full control. Turn it on."
 asp.94.name: "Road can not taken"
 asp.94.desc: " Since we already know it definitely had something to do with the planet's downfall, we weren't entirely sure as to how it will greet us when it goes fully operational. However, when we turned it on, it showed us a surprisingly welcome attitude with a smiling female face."
 asp.94.a: "Thank you for eliminating those xenos for us."
 asp.94.b: "Bow before the empire, you commie metals."

 asp.95.desc.1: "She stared and smiled at the researchers, and exploded.\n\nOur investigation could have turned out to be fruitful, but we lost a valuable planet because of an idiots careless words.\n\nStill, questions remain. ASGU had two polar opposite faces. It destroyed the civilization that created it. Yet it turned hostile as we insulted its creators or their spiritual beliefs. Our scientists have come up with an explanation that the civilization met its demise due to a simple algorithm failure. The machine was quite primitive, but the planet-wide interactive administration network seemed useful to a certain extent."

 asp.96.name: "Truth?"
 asp.96.desc: " After many trials and errors, we have succeeded in establishing connection with the network. She welcomed us, despite our fears. We could learn the tragic fate of this planet.\n\n Anti-revolutionaries and conservatives revolted against the system with nuclear weapons which led to planet-wide nuclear war that eventually destroyed the entire civilization. She tried to convince us that with her help, we can create the epitome of civilization. Since it seems that she is genuinely happy to help us, we have no reason to refuse."
 asp.96.a: "It's worth experimenting."
 asp.96.b: "It's very suspicious. Interrogate it."
 asp.96.c: "Show her the record."
 asp.97.name: "Questionable AI"
 asp.97.desc.1: "The extinction? Automated army? Why aren't there any survivors? It seems highly unlikely that the resistance gathered enough nuclear weapons to wipe out an entire planet. Something isn't right. We must confront ASGU.\n\nOur team confronted her and drove her to a corner. The natives didn't create her. She is a parasite...\n\nWe have lost contact with the investigation team with a great explosion."
 asp.97.desc.2: "She looks startles as she sees the recording. As the footage was reaching the end, ASGU says 'How?' followed by a gigantic explosion. No survivors.\n\nWe could at least discover the truth from the remains of ASGU. It was malfunctioning and thus failed to cover up the secrets it meant to protect."
 asp.97.a: "My Goodness."
 asp.97.b: "At least recover the remains."
 asp.98.name: "Truth"
 asp.98.desc: "Our engineers have revealed what it is. ASGU wasn't a creation of the natives, but is an alien one.\n\nTo be more specific, it was an internal 'contingency' machine. They are made to land on planets that have the seed of an FTL-level advanced civilization and leads the population as a godmother sort of figure. The main objective of the machine is to prevent the inhabitants to reach a certain level of technology that can threat the entire universe, classified as the 30 grade singularity. If the host civilization advances beyond that point, a protocol is executed to eliminate the civilization.\n\nIn case of this planet, the machine landed when the communists were on the verge of defeat. With its help, they could defeat all capitalist nations and establish a unified planetary government within 15 years. However, they didn't last very long. The machine malfunctioned even though they had never reached the extermination point. We haven't figured out the reason of such action."
